## Overview

[SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/) enables you to use full versions of SQL Server in the cloud without having to manage any on-premises hardware. SQL Server virtual machines (VMs) also simplify licensing costs when you pay as you go.

Azure virtual machines run in many different [geographic regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) around the world. They also offer various [machine sizes](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes). The virtual machine image gallery allows you to create a SQL Server VM with the right version, edition, and operating system. This makes virtual machines a good option for many different SQL Server workloads.

**Ready to get started?** Jump to our [quickstart guide](sql-vm-create-portal-quickstart.md) to create your first SQL Server VM, or explore the [feature benefits](#feature-benefits) you unlock by registering with the SQL IaaS Agent extension.

## Feature benefits

When you register your SQL Server on Azure VM with the [SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md), you unlock a number of feature benefits. Registering with the extension is free.

The following table details the benefits unlocked by the extension:

## High availability and disaster recovery

In addition to the built-in [high availability provided by Azure Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/availability), you can use the high availability and disaster recovery features provided by SQL Server.

For more information, see the overview of [Always On availability groups](availability-group-overview.md) and [Always On failover cluster instances](failover-cluster-instance-overview.md). For more information, see the [business continuity overview](business-continuity-high-availability-disaster-recovery-hadr-overview.md).

To get started, see the tutorials for [availability groups](availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet.md) or [preparing your VM for a failover cluster instance](failover-cluster-instance-prepare-vm.md).

## SQL VM images and licensing

To get started, choose a SQL Server virtual machine image with your required version, edition, and operating system. The following sections provide direct links to the Azure portal for the SQL Server virtual machine gallery images. Change the licensing model of a pay-per-usage SQL Server VM to use your own license. For more information, see [How to change the licensing model for a SQL Server VM](licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md).

Azure only maintains one virtual machine image for each supported operating system, version, and edition combination. This maintenance means that over time, Microsoft refreshes images and removes older images. For more information, see the **Images** section of the [SQL Server VMs FAQ](frequently-asked-questions-faq.yml).

> [!TIP]  
> For more information about how to understand pricing for SQL Server images, see [Pricing guidance for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](pricing-guidance.md).

The following table provides a matrix of pay-as-you-go SQL Server images.

To see the available SQL Server on Linux virtual machine images, see [Overview of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (Linux)](../linux/sql-server-on-linux-vm-what-is-iaas-overview.md).

You can deploy an older image of SQL Server that isn't available in the Azure portal by using PowerShell. To view all available images by using PowerShell, use the following command:

```powershell
$Location = "<location>"
Get-AzVMImageOffer -Location $Location -Publisher 'MicrosoftSQLServer'
```

For more information about deploying SQL Server VMs by using PowerShell, see [How to provision SQL Server virtual machines with Azure PowerShell](create-sql-vm-powershell.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Older images might be outdated. Remember to apply all SQL Server and Windows updates before using them for production.

## Azure Hybrid Benefit

Azure Hybrid Benefit grants you the ability to allocate your SQL Server license to your SQL Server on Azure VM. With Azure Hybrid Benefit, you get a discount on the allocation of SQL Server licenses to the SQL Server instance but must still pay for the cost of the underlying cloud compute (that is, the base rate), storage, and backups. You must also pay for I/O associated with their use of the services (as applicable).

To estimate the cost of Pay-as-you-go licensing and see cost savings with the Azure Hybrid benefit use the [Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

According to the Microsoft [Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/MicrosoftAzureServices/EAEAS): "Customers must indicate that they're using Azure SQL Database (SQL Managed Instance, Elastic Pool, and Single Database), Azure Data Factory, SQL Server Integration Services, or SQL Server Virtual Machines under Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server when configuring workloads on Azure."

To indicate the use of Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server on Azure VM and be compliant, you have two options:

- Provision a virtual machine by using a pay-as-you-go SQL Server image from Azure Marketplace and [activate the Azure Hybrid Benefit](licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md#change-license-model).
- Self-install SQL Server on Azure VM, manually [register with the SQL IaaS Agent Extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md), and activate Azure Hybrid Benefit.

The license type of SQL Server can be configured when the VM is provisioned or anytime afterward. Switching between license models incurs no downtime, doesn't restart the VM or the SQL Server service, doesn't add any additional costs, and is effective immediately. In fact, activating Azure Hybrid Benefit *reduces* cost.

## Customer experience improvement program (CEIP)

The Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) is enabled by default. This program periodically sends reports to Microsoft to help improve SQL Server. You don't need to manage CEIP unless you want to disable it after provisioning. You can customize or disable the CEIP by connecting to the VM with [Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview). Then run the **SQL Server Error and Usage Reporting** utility. Follow the instructions to disable reporting. For more information about data collection, see the [SQL Server Privacy Statement](/sql/sql-server/sql-server-privacy).
