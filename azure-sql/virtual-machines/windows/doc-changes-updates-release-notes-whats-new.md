When you deploy an Azure virtual machine (VM) with SQL Server installed on it, either manually, or through a built-in image, you can use Azure features to improve your experience. This article summarizes the documentation changes associated with new features and improvements in the recent releases of [SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/). To learn more about SQL Server on Azure VMs, see the [overview](sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview.md). 

For updates made in previous years, see the [What's new archive](doc-changes-updates-release-notes-whats-new-archive.md).

## Preview

The following table lists the features of SQL Server on Azure VMs that are currently in preview.

> [!NOTE]  
> Features currently in preview are available under [supplemental terms of use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), review for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability. SQL Server on Azure VMs provide previews to give you a chance to evaluate and [share feedback with the product group](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/forum/04fe6ee0-3b25-ec11-b6e6-000d3a4f0da0) on features before they become generally available (GA).

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| [Modernization Advisor](../modernization-advisor.md) | Use the Modernization Advisor in the Azure portal to help you determine if migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance saves you money or optimizes performance. |
| [Premium SSD v2 in the Azure portal](storage-configuration-premium-ssd-v2.md) | Deploy your SQL Server on Azure VM with Premium SSD v2 disks in the Azure portal for improved throughput and performance. |  

## General availability (GA)

The following table lists features of SQL Server on Azure VMs that have been made generally available (GA) within the last 12 months:

| Changes | Month | Details |
| --- | --- |--- |
| [I/O Analysis](storage-performance-analysis.md) | April 2025 | Use the Azure portal to identify performance issues with your SQL Server workloads from exceeding virtual machine and data disk limits. | 
| [Azure Elastic SAN](storage-configuration-azure-elastic-san.md) | March 2025 | Place your SQL Server workloads on an Azure Elastic SAN for improved performance, throughput, and cost. |
| [FCI with Azure Elastic SAN](failover-cluster-instance-azure-elastic-san-manually-configure.md) | March 2025 | Deploy your SQL Server failover cluster instance (FCI) by using an Azure Elastic SAN. |
| [Managed identity support for SQL Server 2022 on Azure VM](managed-identity-extensible-key-management.md) | January 2025 | Starting with SQL Server 2022 Cumulative Update 17 (CU17), managed identities are supported for SQL Server on Azure VMs (Windows only). Managed identities can be used with [SQL Server credentials](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-credential-transact-sql) to [back up to and restore SQL Server on Azure VM databases from Azure Blob storage](backup-restore-to-url-using-managed-identities.md). Support for managed identities also enables functionalities like [Extensible Key Management (EKM) with Azure Key Vault (AKV) and Managed Hardware Security Modules (HSM)](managed-identity-extensible-key-management.md) to be used with SQL Server on Azure VMs. |
| [Mbv3 VM series](performance-guidelines-best-practices-vm-size.md#mbsv3-and-mbdsv3-series) | November 2024 | A powerful new VM series that currently delivers a high level of IOPs and GB throughput, with strong memory capabilities up to the 176 vCore count for a consistent 8:1 memory-to-vCore ratio in this series. Both VMs in the series offer a consistent 64 maximum data disks per VM size, allowing you to maximize storage performance and still allow fully scalability across the table. The Mbdsv3 VMs in the series have the highest IOPS and GB throughput VMs available in Azure and can scale up to 4 TiBs at the 176 vCore level.|
| [Azure Update Manager](../azure-update-manager-sql-vm.md) | April 2024 | Automatically patch multiple SQL Server VMs at scale with the Azure Update Manager integrated in to the [SQL virtual machines](manage-sql-vm-portal.md) resource in the Azure portal, including Cumulative Updates. |

## Documentation changes 

Learn about significant changes to the SQL Server on Azure VMs documentation. For previous years, see the [What's new archive](doc-changes-updates-release-notes-whats-new-archive.md).

### September 2025

| Changes | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **New Azure SQL hub** | Choosing the right Azure SQL service can be challenging. To make this easier, we built the [Azure SQL hub at aka.ms/azuresqlhub](https://aka.ms/azuresqlhub), a new home for everything related to Azure SQL in the Azure portal. For more information, read the blog post [Introducing the Azure SQL hub: A simpler, guided entry into Azure SQL](https://aka.ms/azuresqlhubblog). | 

### May 2025

| Changes | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **SQL Server 2025 Preview** | SQL Server 2025 Preview is now [available to deploy as an image](sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview.md#sql-vm-images-and-licensing) for SQL Server on Azure VMs. Review [SQL Server 2025 preview](/sql/sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-2025) to learn more.  |

### April 2025

| Changes | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **I/O Analysis GA** | Use the Azure portal to identify performance issues with your SQL Server workloads from exceeding virtual machine and data disk limits. This feature is now generally available (GA). Review [I/O Analysis](storage-performance-analysis.md) to learn more. | 
|**Place `tempdb` to ephemeral storage** | If you're manually installing SQL Server to an Azure VM, be sure to [place `tempdb` on ephemeral storage](../windows/tempdb-ephemeral-storage.md) to improve performance. This is a best practice for SQL Server on Azure VMs. |

### March 2025

| Changes | Details |
| --- | --- |
